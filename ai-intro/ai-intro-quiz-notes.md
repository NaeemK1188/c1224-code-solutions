  Contribute: As you advance, explore building your own AI tools or integrations.
  Conclusion: AI is a powerful assistant, but your growth as a software developer depends on a balanced approach. Use AI to accelerate learning, simplify complex topics, and gain real-world experience while maintaining a strong foundation in manual problem-solving and coding.

- What is the danger of using AI tools for software development while I'm still learning?

  Noah Khayat Answer:

  it will causes a decline in cognitive thinking or we will not see anymore
  new inventors because of letting the AI doing everything to us. In the same
  time, AI will be extremely beneficial in developing new ideas, so instead of focusing on minor subjects like coding
  the AI or oir agent will do this for us, and we will be responsible on creating apps and programs

  ChatGpt Answer:

  Using AI tools while learning software development can be incredibly helpful, but it also comes with potential dangers. Here are some risks and how to mitigate them:

  1. Over-Reliance on AI
     Danger: You might become dependent on AI for solving problems, writing code, or debugging, which can hinder your ability to learn the underlying concepts.

  Solution:

  Use AI as a guide, not a crutch. Strive to understand the code or solutions AI provides before implementing them.
  Regularly solve problems without AI to reinforce your critical thinking and problem-solving skills. 2. Skipping Fundamentals
  Danger: AI tools often give solutions without explaining the foundational concepts, which can leave gaps in your knowledge.

  Solution:

  Focus on building a strong understanding of programming basics.
  When AI provides code or answers, take the time to break down and analyze the logic. 3. Lack of Debugging Practice
  Danger: AI can debug your code for you, reducing your exposure to one of the most valuable learning experiences in software development.

  Solution:

  Attempt to debug issues manually before turning to AI for assistance.
  Use AI as a tutor to explain debugging processes rather than just fixing errors. 4. Inaccurate or Suboptimal Solutions
  Danger: AI tools are not infallible and might provide incorrect, insecure, or inefficient solutions.

  Solution:

  Always review AI-generated code for errors, security vulnerabilities, or inefficiencies.
  Research and verify solutions from multiple sources. 5. Stifling Creativity
  Danger: Relying on AI to generate ideas or solutions can limit your ability to think creatively and approach problems in unique ways.

  Solution:

  Use AI for inspiration, not as the sole source of ideas.
  Challenge yourself to come up with solutions independently before consulting AI. 6. Ethical Risks
  Danger: You might inadvertently misuse AI-generated code that is copyrighted, plagiarized, or violates ethical standards.

  Solution:

  Understand the licensing and usage terms of the code you use.
  Avoid copying large code snippets without modifications or understanding. 7. Lack of Personal Growth
