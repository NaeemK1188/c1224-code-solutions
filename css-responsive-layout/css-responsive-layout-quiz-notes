## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?

  change of the behavior of the webpage styling or the point at which change occurs

- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?

  1.50% is more dynamic, which always is 50% of the column in any screen size like relative position where other
  objects are aware of its presence(the object with width 50%)
  2. 500px is a fixed size os static where it always stays 500px or its not relative to the screen size like
  absolute position

- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?

  Because the specificity rules. In @media it depends how we create the logic of its expression to be met.
